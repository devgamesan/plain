# Peneo

[日本語版 README](README.ja.md)

Peneo is a Textual-based TUI file manager that aims to feel closer to a GUI explorer.
It is designed so you can reach the main actions without having to study a Vim-style key map first.

_Current three-pane UI showing the parent, current, and child directories side by side._

## Features

- Three-pane layout for parent / current / child directories
- Keyboard-only navigation, selection, copy, cut, paste, delete, rename, and create flows
- Filter input, sort switching, and hidden-file visibility toggle
- Less frequent actions grouped into a command palette so everyday keys stay small in number
- Files open with the OS default app, `e` opens the current file in the editor inside the current terminal, and a terminal can also be launched in the current directory

## Current Capabilities

- Browse directories and move through the filesystem
- Multi-select files and directories
- copy / cut / paste
- Move items to trash
- Rename a single target
- Create files and directories
- Filter by file name
- Switch sorting by name / modified time / size
- Toggle directories-first ordering
- Copy paths to the system clipboard
- Launch a terminal in the current directory
- Toggle hidden-file visibility
- Open files with the OS default app
- Open files in the editor inside the current terminal

## Installation

With `uv` installed, clone the repository and install Peneo as a tool.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devgamesan/peneo.git
cd peneo
uv tool install --from . peneo
```

To update, pull the latest changes and run the same install command again.

## Run

```bash
peneo
```

To launch directly from a local checkout during development, run this from the repository root:

```bash
uv run peneo
```

If you want the last directory from Peneo to become your shell's current directory when you quit, you can optionally enable shell integration:

```bash
eval "$(peneo init bash)"
# or
eval "$(peneo init zsh)"
```

After that, launch the optional wrapper instead of `peneo`:

```bash
peneo-cd
```

This setup is optional. Normal usage with `peneo` or `uv run peneo` still works without any shell configuration.

## Basic Operations

The main keys are listed below.

| State | Key | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | `↑` / `k` | Move the cursor |
| Normal | `↓` / `j` | Move the cursor |
| Normal | `←` / `h` / `Backspace` | Move to the parent directory |
| Normal | `→` / `l` | Enter the item if it is a directory |
| Normal | `Enter` | Enter a directory, or open a file with the default app |
| Normal | `e` | Open the focused file in the editor inside the current terminal |
| Normal | `F5` | Reload the current directory |
| Normal | `Space` | Toggle selection, then move to the next row |
| Normal | `y` | Copy the selected items, or the focused item if nothing is selected |
| Normal | `x` | Cut the selected items, or the focused item if nothing is selected |
| Normal | `p` | Paste into the current directory |
| Normal | `Delete` | Move the selected items, or the focused item, to trash |
| Normal | `F2` | Start rename input for a single target |
| Normal | `/` | Start filter input |
| Normal | `s` | Cycle the sort order |
| Normal | `d` | Toggle directories-first ordering |
| Normal | `q` | Quit the app |
| Normal | `Esc` | Clear the active filter, otherwise clear the selection |
| Normal | `:` | Open the command palette |
| Filter input | Text input | Update the filter string |
| Filter input | `Backspace` | Delete one character |
| Filter input | `Enter` / `↓` | Apply the filter and return to list navigation |
| Filter input | `Esc` | Clear the filter |
| Command palette | Text input / `↑` / `↓` / `k` / `j` / `Enter` / `Esc` | Filter commands, or search and jump to files |
| Name input | Text input / `Backspace` / `Enter` / `Esc` | Edit, confirm, or cancel rename/create input |
| Confirmation dialog | `Enter` / `Esc` | Confirm or cancel delete |
| Confirmation dialog | `o` / `s` / `r` / `Esc` | Resolve a paste conflict with overwrite / skip / rename / cancel |

## Command Palette

Less frequent actions are grouped in the command palette opened with `:`.
The currently available commands are:

- `Create file`
- `Create directory`
- `Find file`
- `Copy path`
- `Open terminal here`
- `Show hidden files` / `Hide hidden files`

`Find file` searches recursively under the current directory using a case-insensitive partial match on the filename, then jumps to the selected result by opening its parent directory and focusing that file. Hidden paths are excluded unless hidden-file visibility is enabled. When there are many hits, the palette shows a moving window around the current cursor so you can inspect all matches with the arrow keys without clipping the list.

Commands still under development may appear dimmed and cannot be executed yet.

## Platform Notes

- The project is currently verified only on Ubuntu.
- The code contains external-launch implementations for Linux / macOS / Windows, but not every platform path is fully validated.
- The application is still under active development, so behavior and keybindings may change.
- File mutations operate on the selected directory entry. If the selected item is a symlink, Peneo mutates the symlink itself instead of silently following and mutating the link target.
